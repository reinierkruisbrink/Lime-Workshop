# Lime-Workshop

This workshop is designed to equip participants with techniques to enhance the business value of machine learning applications with a focus on sustainability. It covers strategies for understanding and successfully defining project scopes to decrease the chances of wasting resources, while also investigating various methods to evaluate the performance of your models.

What metrics should you use to optimize your ML model? How should you communicate these metrics to your stakeholders to indicate business value?

Ultimately, this workshop will look into ways to explain your model's decisions to improve the model and gain insights on the nature of the problem.
